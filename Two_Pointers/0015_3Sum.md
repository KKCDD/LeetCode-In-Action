# Leetcode 0015. 3Sum

## Problem Description
Given an array `nums` of `n` integers, are there elements `a, b, c` in `nums` such that `a + b + c = 0`? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

For example, given array `nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]`, a solution set is `[[-1, 0, 1], [-1, -1, 2]]`.


## Solution
Python Solution using Two Pointers:
```python
def threeSum(nums):
    nums.sort()
    result = []
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
            continue
        left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            s = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
            if s < 0:
                left += 1
            elif s > 0:
                right -= 1
            else:
                result.append((nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]))
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:
                    left += 1
                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:
                    right -= 1
                left += 1
                right -= 1
    return result
```

Step-by-step explanation:
1. We sort the array.
2. We iterate over the array. For each number, we use it as the first number of the triplet and find two numbers in the remaining array that sum up to the negative of the first number.
3. We use two pointers, left and right, to find the two numbers. If the sum of the three numbers is less than zero, we move the left pointer to the right. If the sum is greater than zero, we move the right pointer to the left. If the sum is zero, we add the triplet to the result.
4. We skip the same numbers to avoid duplicate triplets.

Complexity analysis:
- Time complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are using two nested loops.
- Space complexity: O(n) or O(log n), depending on the implementation of the sorting algorithm. This is because we are storing the sorted array and the result.
