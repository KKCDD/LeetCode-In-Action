# Leetcode 0018. 4Sum

## Problem Description
Given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `target`, are there elements `a, b, c, and d` in `nums` such that `a + b + c + d = target`? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of `target`.

For example, given array `nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2]`, and `target = 0`, a solution set is `[[-1,  0, 0, 1], [-2, -1, 1, 2], [-2,  0, 0, 2]]`.

## Solution
Python Solution using Two Pointers:
```python
def fourSum(nums, target):
    def findNsum(nums, target, N, result, results):
        if len(nums) < N or N < 2 or target < nums[0]*N or target > nums[-1]*N:  # early termination
            return
        if N == 2:  # two pointers solve sorted 2-sum problem
            l, r = 0, len(nums)-1
            while l < r:
                s = nums[l] + nums[r]
                if s == target:
                    results.append(result + [nums[l], nums[r]])
                    l += 1
                    while l < r and nums[l] == nums[l - 1]:
                        l += 1
                elif s < target:
                    l += 1
                else:
                    r -= 1
        else:  # recursively reduce N
            for i in range(len(nums)-N+1):
                if i == 0 or (i > 0 and nums[i-1] != nums[i]):
                    findNsum(nums[i+1:], target-nums[i], N-1, result+[nums[i]], results)

    results = []
    findNsum(sorted(nums), target, 4, [], results)
    return results
```

Step-by-step explanation:
1. We define a helper function `findNsum` that finds N numbers in the array that sum up to the target.
2. If N is 2, we use two pointers to find the two numbers. If the sum of the two numbers is equal to the target, we add the numbers to the result. If the sum is less than the target, we move the left pointer to the right. If the sum is greater than the target, we move the right pointer to the left.
3. If N is greater than 2, we recursively call `findNsum` with N reduced by 1.
4. We call `findNsum` with N set to 4 to find quadruplets.
5. We return the result.

Complexity analysis:
- Time complexity: O(n^3), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are using three nested loops in the worst case.
- Space complexity: O(n). This is because we are storing the result.
