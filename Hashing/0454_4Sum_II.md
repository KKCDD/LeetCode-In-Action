# Leetcode 0454. 4Sum II

## Problem Description
Given four lists A, B, C, D of integer values, compute how many tuples `(i, j, k, l)` there are such that `A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l]` is zero.

For example, given `A = [ 1, 2]`, `B = [-2,-1]`, `C = [-1, 2]`, `D = [ 0, 2]`, return `2` because there are two tuples `(i, j, k, l)` such that `A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l]` is zero: `(0, 1, 0, 1)` and `(1, 0, 0, 1)`.

## Solution
Python Solution:
```python
def fourSumCount(A, B, C, D):
    # Use a dictionary to count the sums of pairs in A and B
    AB = {}
    for a in A:
        for b in B:
            AB[a + b] = AB.get(a + b, 0) + 1

    # Initialize the count of tuples
    count = 0
    for c in C:
        for d in D:
            # If the negative of the sum of c and d is in the dictionary, add the count to the total count
            if -c - d in AB:
                count += AB[-c - d]

    return count
```

Step-by-step explanation:
1. We use a dictionary to count the sums of pairs in A and B.
2. We initialize the count of tuples.
3. We iterate over C and D. For each pair, if the negative of the sum is in the dictionary, we add the count to the total count.

Complexity analysis:
- Time complexity: O(n^2), where n is the length of the lists. This is because we are traversing the lists twice, once to count the sums and once to count the tuples.
- Space complexity: O(n^2). This is because we are storing the counts of the sums. In the worst case, all pairs have different sums, so the space complexity is the square of the length of the lists.
